1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When i am working on the same project on multiple devices or when we have more than one member working on the same project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: It reduces the overhead as well as better control on merging as well.
